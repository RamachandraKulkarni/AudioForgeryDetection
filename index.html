                <p>If you try to listen to the audio files, they are very similar and virtually indistinguishable to the human ear. If you pay very close attention, you can make out faint distortions in the fake audio files generated by MelGAN. Isolated from each other and without a direct comparison, it is quite difficult to identify and differentiate them. Let's take a closer look at their features.</p>
